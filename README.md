"# tides_sa" 

Tides_sa is a personal project that fetches weather and tide data from 3rd party vendors specifically for the South African coast line

If it does not work, its most likely that the API key needs updating 
(Its a mess to sort out if you dont know what is going, I will clean up the code in time)

To get up and running:

Clone
  
    git clone https://github.com/VaughnDV/tides_sa.git
    

Install requirements

    pip install requirements.txt


Run 

    python app.py
